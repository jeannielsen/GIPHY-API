# GIPHY-API

Description:  
The assignment was to use GIPHY API populated with gifs of the studentâ€™s choice.  The GIPHY API must be called and JavaScript and jQuery must be used to change the HTML of the site.

Languages Used:
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX

Takeaways:
The GIPHY API was fun to work with and accessing the data was not as difficult as I initial thought it would be, but manipulating the data afterwards was the challenging part.

Feedback:
I need to work on the naming of variables.  There were too many similar names, that became very confusing when attempting to debug the program.
